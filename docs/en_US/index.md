Presentation 
============

This plugin allows you to manage GCE Ecodevice cards.

Initially, this plugin was created to connect GCE Ecodevices.

Data visible on the Dashboard : 
-----------------------------------

-   '''Tele-information counters '''

-   '''pulse counters'''

Refresh rate 
-----------------------------

The plugin updates this data in 2 ways :

Data is retrieved by the plugin every minute for everyone
the counters. It is not possible to have a higher frequency.

For flow rates, instantaneous consumption and Apparent Power a
collection is done by a daemon according to the set frequency
plugin level. Please note, a large decrease generates a large
overloading your jeedom server.

Installation / Setup 
========================

We will now configure a device. To do so, click
on '' 'Plugins / Home automation protocol / Eco-device'''.

Then click on the button at the top left "'' 'Add a
Equipment'''".

Then enter the name of the equipment (ex. Ecodevice 1).

Then define :

-   '''Parent object'''

-   '''Category '' '(optional)

-   '''Activate '' '(check, otherwise the equipment will not be usable)

-   '''Visible '' '(optional if you don't want to make it visible on
    the Dashboard)

-   '''IP adress'''

-   '''Port'''

-   '''Account'''

-   '''Password'''

is not defined, commands are not created.

By default it is every minute. It is possible to configure
manually push on the ecodevice. For debits, consumption
instantaneous and apparent power can be collected more
frequently depending on the demon.

It is entirely possible via
[Github](https://Github.com/guenneguezt/plugin-ecodevice)

To calculate the fuel flow in one hour of operation,
know the marking of your fuel nozzle. For that, you
find the information in [the doc
suivant](http://fr.cd.danfoss.com/PCMPDF/DKBDPD060A204.pdf).

The value given is in USgal / Hour with the correspondence in Kg / H.

For the density of the fuel, we can take 820Kg / m³ and a pressure of 7
bar.

So if you have a nozzle marked 0.65S : 2.67 kg / h (depending on
Danfoss painting). 2.67x0.82 = 2.1894 liters per hour. This gives a
"approximate" indication of your consumption.

Yes, it was not written by me, but has the merit of existing.
